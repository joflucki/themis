**A proactive internet assistant designed to help users debunk misinformation and access reliable information through dynamic interactions and fact-based responses**

Themis is an internet assistant designed to help users debunk misinformation and access reliable, fact-based information online. The goal of this project is to create an intelligent, autonomous, proactive tool that can assist users in identifying false claims and promote informed decision-making on the internet.

> The death of truth is the ultimate victory of evil. When truth leaves us, when we let it slip away, when it is ripped from our hands, we become vulnerable to the appetite of whatever monster screams the loudest.
